                    There were many mangas missing key information such
                    as their release date or rating. So, I began by cleaning
                    the data, removing mangas that had no ratings or categories.
                    For the remaining mangas without a release year, if the information
                    was not easily accessible, I removed them as well. Since the number
                    was small, I manually added the missing years. I also removed any
                    duplicates that existed in the dataset. As a result, the dataset
                    was reduced from 70,393 mangas to 27,028.

                        Since manga categories were originally listed in a single cell

        <h2 id="chartkey">Charts and Key Insights</h2>
        <p id="chart1">
            The average manga ratings are quite unstable before
            1980. However, from 1980 until 2022, we see a clear
            upward trend. The trendline suggests that this increase
            could continue in the future.
        </p>
        <p id="chart2">
            In the dataset, the majority of manga are concentrated in 
            the year ranges between 2011-2020 and 2000-2010. Additionally, 
            the average release year for manga in these ranges is 2006 and 
            2016, respectively.
        </p>
        <img src="9.png">
        <p id="chart3">
            The most frequently used categories, which also have the highest-rated 
            manga (with average ratings between 4.6 and 4.7), include Romance, Yaoi—where 
            half of the manga are categorized—Drama, Comedy, School, Fantasy, Full Color, 
            Webtoons, Action, and Manhwa. The latter categories represent about a quarter 
            of the dataset. It is worth noting that very few manga have ratings above 4.6 out of 5.
        </p>
        <img src="10.png">
        <p id="chart4">The correlation table reveals certain categories that appear frequently together and have strong 
        correlations, such as Webtoons and Full Color, with a correlation coefficient of 0.897. On the 
        other hand, some combinations, like Romance and Action, show very low correlation, with a coefficient 
        of -0.298. Most categories, however, tend to be relatively independent of one another.</p>

    <!-------------------INTERP------------------>
    <section class="interp" id="interp">
        <h2 id="int"> Interpretation </h2>
        <p id="interp1">
            The instability of average manga ratings before 1980 
            likely reflects the smaller number of mangas released during 
            that period, making it difficult to draw consistent conclusions. 
            The upward trend in ratings from 1980 onwards suggests either an 
            improvement in manga quality over time or changes in audience 
            preferences that have resulted in higher ratings. The trendline further 
            suggests that, if these patterns continue, we could expect average 
            ratings to keep rising in the future. </p>
        <p id="interp2">The concentration of manga releases in the 2000-2020 range indicates a
            period of rapid growth in the industry, possibly due to the global 
            popularity of manga and the rise of digital platforms. The average 
            release years of 2006 and 2016 highlight key periods of manga production, 
            aligning with significant developments in publishing and distribution. </p>
        <p id="interp3">Categories such as Romance, Yaoi, Drama, and others not only dominate the 
            dataset in terms of the number of mangas but also show a tendency to 
            have higher ratings. This suggests that these genres may appeal more 
            to the audience or attract better-quality works. Conversely, the rarity of mangas 
            with ratings above 4.6 indicates that 
            exceptional ratings are hard to achieve, which may reflect stricter 
            reader standards or the challenges of producing universally acclaimed works.</p>
        <p id="interp4">
            The strong correlations, particularly between Webtoons and Full Color, Full Color 
            and Manhwa, Manhwa and Webtoons, as well as Fantasy and Adventure, suggest that these 
            categories frequently co-occur in the dataset. This likely reflects the specific style 
            and format associated with these categories. For instance, many Webtoons are both in 
            full color and originate from South Korea (Manhwa), while Fantasy and Adventure are 
            genres that often share similar narrative elements, making their frequent pairing 
            unsurprising. The general independence of most other categories indicates that manga 
            genres tend to stand alone, catering to distinct audience preferences.

        <h2 id="summa"> Summary of discoveries </h2>
        <p id="sum1">
            In summary, the analysis of manga data reveals several key trends. 
            First, the instability in ratings prior to 1980 contrasts sharply with 
            the steady increase in ratings from 1980 onward, suggesting a shift in 
            either manga quality or audience preferences. The concentration of manga 
            releases between 2000 and 2020 highlights a boom in the industry, driven 
            in part by digital platforms. Popular categories like Romance, Yaoi, Drama, 
            and Comedy not only dominate in numbers but also tend to have higher ratings, 
            indicating a strong audience appeal. However, very few mangas surpass a rating 
            of 4.6, reflecting the challenge of achieving exceptional ratings. </p>
        <p id="sum2">The correlation analysis reveals strong connections between certain categories, 
            especially Webtoons, Full Color, Manhwa, Fantasy, and Adventure, which frequently 
            appear together. This suggests that certain formats and genres naturally complement 
            each other, driving higher reader engagement. </p>

            Based on these findings, future analysis could explore the influence of individual 
            authors, publishers, or studios on manga success. Additionally, investigating the 
            role of digital distribution and international readership could provide deeper 
            insights into the global expansion of the industry. Lastly, conducting sentiment 
            analysis on user reviews might offer more nuanced explanations behind the ratings, 
            helping to identify specific factors that drive higher reader satisfaction. </p>

            This project has deepened my understanding of data analysis and its practical application 
            in exploring trends within a specific industry like manga. I have enhanced my skills 
            in data cleaning and transformation, particularly using Power Query to handle complex 
            categorical data. </p>
        <p id="learn2">Through this project, I have also improved my ability to visualize data effectively, 
            making insights more accessible and understandable through clear charts and tables. 
            I learned how to set up and utilize segments to focus on specific years or categories, 
            which greatly enhanced my analytical capabilities. Understanding how to apply these 
            segments allowed me to dissect data more effectively, providing clearer insights into 
            trends and patterns within targeted subsets of the data. </p>
