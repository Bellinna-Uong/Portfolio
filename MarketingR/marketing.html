                            Similarly, MntWines and MntTotal are highly correlated (corr = 0.9617), as well as MntMeatProducts

    <!-------------------A NEW MODEL------------------>
    <section class="model">
        <h2 id="newmodel-h2">A ridge linear model</h2>
        <p id="newmodel1">
            I use the glmnet function to fit regression models, which helps 
            regularize the coefficients in order to better handle issues like 
            multicollinearity. This method reduces the impact of highly correlated 
            variables while retaining all variables in the model, as some of the 
            remaining variables still exhibit strong correlations.
        </p>
        <p id="newmodel2">
            We proceed by fitting the Ridge model using glmnet, and this new model 
            will be referred to as 'best_model'. The next step is to display the 
            coefficients of each variable, which is crucial for interpreting the model 
            and understanding the relative importance of each explanatory variable.
        </p>
        <img src="pic/7.png">
        <p id="newmodel3">
            In our case, for a linear regression, each coefficient will indicate how much the 
            target variable changes on average for a one-unit change in the explanatory variable, 
            holding all other factors constant. This means that each coefficient represents the 
            isolated effect of the corresponding variable on the target, providing insight into 
            the relationship between the predictors and the outcome of interest.
        </p>
        <img src="pic/8.png" class="coeffpng">
        <p id="newmodel4">
            In the model, variables with non-zero coefficients are considered to have an impact on 
            the target variable. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the explanatory 
            variable leads to an increase in the target variable. Conversely, a negative coefficient
            implies that an increase in the explanatory variable results in a decrease in the target 
            variable. Variables with zero coefficients can be ignored in the interpretation, as they do 
            not significantly influence the outcome.
        </p>
        <p id="newmodel5">
            We created a linear model (using the lm function) and then generated a summary of the results. 
            The R² value is 0.431, indicating that the model explains approximately 43.1% of the total variance 
            in the dependent variable. This suggests that the model captures a significant portion of the observed 
            variability. The F-test evaluates the overall significance of the model. </p>
        <p id="newmodel6">With an F-statistic of 66.01 
            and a p-value close to zero (p-value : 2.2e-16), this implies that the model as a whole is statistically 
            significant. In other words, at least one of the independent variables has a significant effect on the dependent variable. 
            The analysis also reveals notable trends: for each additional teenager in the household, there is a 0.059 decrease in the 
            likelihood of accepting the marketing campaign.
        </p>
        <img src="pic/11.png">
        <p id="newmodel7">
            In our model, we found that each promotional purchase is linked to a decrease of 0.0366 in the acceptance rate, while each in-store 
            purchase results in a reduction of 0.02528. Conversely, customers who accepted the most recent campaign show a significant increase of 
            0.6566 in the dependent variable. Regarding education, levels such as Second Cycle, Basic, and Graduation are associated with higher 
            response rates, highlighting the significant influence of education on attitudes related to the dependent variable.

    <!-------------------TEST------------------>
    <section class="test" id="test">
        <h2 id="test-h2">Statistical test to data</h2>
        <div class="text-test">
            <p id="test1">
                We will conduct normality (Shapiro-Wilk), heteroscedasticity (Breusch-Pagan), and residual autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson) tests, 
                with a significance threshold of 0.05 for each.
            </p>
            <p id="test2">
                The Shapiro-Wilk test checks whether the residuals of a regression model follow a normal distribution. The normality of residuals is crucial 
                for certain regression models, particularly for the validity of significance tests (p-values) and confidence intervals.
            </p>
            <p id="test3">
                The homoscedasticity assumption (constant variance of errors) is a key condition in classical linear regression. If this assumption is violated 
                (i.e., heteroscedasticity is present), the standard errors of the estimated coefficients may be inaccurate, affecting the reliability of p-values 
                and confidence intervals. A model with heteroscedasticity can produce less reliable predictions and underestimate the variability of the estimates.
            </p>

                The Durbin-Watson test checks for autocorrelation of residuals, meaning whether the errors (residuals) of a model are correlated with each other. 
                If residuals are correlated, it indicates that the model has not captured all the structure in the data. Autocorrelation can result in inefficient 
                coefficient estimates, which impacts the model's predictive power.

            Without a doubt, the vast majority of customers did not respond 
            positively to any of the advertising campaigns we conducted. We 
            should focus on identifying the key criteria related to our customers 
            behavior patterns. By doing so, we can better allocate our marketing 
            investments, ensuring that they are targeted and more likely to yield positive results.

            We can observe that nearly all customers shop in-store, yet many do not use the catalog. 
            This presents an opportunity to improve either by revising the catalog content or increasing 
            its distribution to a broader audience. Additionally, the store's website plays a significant 
            role in driving purchases. We could consider investing more in digital marketing to attract more 
            customers, especially in today's increasingly digital era.

        <p id="agecorr">We observe that most customers are between 30 and 70 years old, which can be identified as adults, parents, or even grandparents. <br>
            The graph shows the correlation between customer age and the number of accepted advertising campaigns (`AcceptedCmpOverall`). Each point represents a customer, with age on the x-axis and the number of accepted campaigns on the y-axis. <br>

            It appears that campaign acceptance is not strongly influenced by age. The acceptance values are spread across all age groups without a clear trend. This suggests that there is no obvious relationship between age and the likelihood of accepting advertising campaigns, indicating that a marketing strategy targeting based solely on age would not be optimal. Instead, it would be better to design campaigns that appeal to a broad audience to maximize reach.</p>

        <h2 id="interp-h2"> Interpretation </h2>
        <p id="interp1">
            In conclusion, our analysis reveals important insights into customer behavior and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Although we initially hypothesized that factors like age might play a crucial role in campaign acceptance, the data shows otherwise. The correlation analysis suggests no clear relationship between age and campaign acceptance, indicating that targeted age-specific marketing may not be effective. </p>
        <p id="interp2">Instead, our findings highlight the importance of a broad, inclusive marketing approach. The correlation between income and total spending suggests that customers with higher incomes tend to spend more across all categories, emphasizing the need for targeted offers based on purchasing power rather than demographic characteristics such as age.</p>
        <p id="interp3">Moreover, the variable selection process and Ridge regression model helped refine the predictive power by focusing on the most impactful factors, thereby improving the model's robustness and interpretability. The statistical tests indicate that our model meets the assumptions necessary for reliable analysis, providing confidence in the results.</p>
        <p id="interp4">
            In terms of actionable strategies, improving catalog usage and investing in digital marketing channels appear to be promising areas. The store's website has proven to be a significant driver of purchases, suggesting that enhancing our digital marketing efforts could attract more customers, particularly in today's digital landscape.
        </p>
        <p id="interp5">Ultimately, our goal should be to identify the key behavioral criteria that can guide marketing investment, ensuring that campaigns are both efficient and effective, maximizing response rates and improving return on investment.</p>

    <section class="recom" id="recom">
        <h2 id="recom-h2"> Recommendation </h2>
        <p id="recomtext">
            First, a detailed customer segmentation analysis should be conducted to design more targeted campaigns for different groups. Additionally, further behavioral analysis could help identify motivations behind purchasing decisions, providing more refined targeting criteria. A/B testing of different campaign versions would allow us to determine the most effective approaches, while incorporating additional data sources, such as social media engagement or geographic data, could improve predictive accuracy. <br>
            Analyzing customer feedback, such as reviews or survey responses, through sentiment analysis can guide improvements. Cross-channel analysis is also recommended to understand the interaction between marketing channels and optimize resource allocation. A longitudinal study would help track customer behavior over time, anticipating trends and maintaining campaign relevance. Finally, experimenting with catalog content and expanding digital marketing would help increase engagement across different customer segments. </p>
